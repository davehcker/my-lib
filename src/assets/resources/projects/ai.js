<p><strong>Background:</strong> I&#39;ll need an essay for this; but in short and as counterintuitive it sounds, it is not very easy for hackers/programmers to get into the field of AI. There are of course multiple tutorials and courses that promise to teach AI, and they do so (or do they?). The trouble is that unless its developement can be traced from its principles and the fundamentals grokked, the learner doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and is usually helpless when it comes to improvising or learning by &#39;hacking&#39; in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To prepare a reading material (well, it&#39;s going to be a book) that can fill in the gap between theory and practice in the field of AI.</p>
<p><strong>Progress:</strong> I intend to wrap up the work by August 2019. Progress can be seen <a href="https://davehcker.github.io/airu/">here</a>.</p>
