<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To setup a test-bed to do vulnerability testing of various devices like power grid relays, IP camera and branded thermostats.</p>
<p><strong>Major Findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>With proper planning, a team of very few dedicated engineers can &#39;smartify&#39; a house, town or even a city.</li>
<li>Major devices that control an awful too much of our urban life are vulnerable! I have personally tested GE devices and names like Nest. Usually, these devices have on or  more weak points (usually because of bad implementation), but that is enough for hackers to wreak havoc. DISCLAIMER: The fact that I have mentioned these names is accidental as I got to test only these devices but in the defence of these device makers, these devices are supposed to be deployed in a highly secure premises.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST Cybersecurity Frameworks</a> offer one of the best cybersecurity practices.</li>
