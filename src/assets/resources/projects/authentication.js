Authentication = `
<p><strong>Background:</strong> I am a strong believer in usable security. Some salesmen sold a piece of MFA layer for all our logins across the different services. I realized it was not only painful, but this MFA was changing the behavior of people in a negative way; for instance, people were not logging out as much as they used to, because the cost of logging in back was too much.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To get rid of MFA, in general, any multi-layered authentication system and at the same time guarantee that the resulting security is at par, if not better, than a system with only MFA.</p>

This became my undergrad capstone in Computer Science. I have explored the topic from multiple dimensions and with the application of a bit of psycholocial concepts and Machine Learning and some clever programming, the goal can be achieved. Very partial description of the literature and my thought process can be found <a href="https://github.com/davehcker/passauth/blob/master/index.md.md">here</a>.</p>
