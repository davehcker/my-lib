export var Bitcoin 

Bitcoin = `<p><strong>Background:</strong>I was working with some friends on a startup idea- AML and ATF in the Bitcoin network. I was a sort of pro decentralization in the beginningand blah blah, but when we started connecting the dots, things got really dark, and even worse, it was all a rabbit hole. </p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Given the Bitcoin Network, find, hunt, and de-anonymize as many accounts as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Only with &#39;publically&#39; accessible data, we could infer 792 accounts. Using this information, we were then able to apply some data science and Machine Learning tricks to de-anonymize 1.625 million accounts.</p>
