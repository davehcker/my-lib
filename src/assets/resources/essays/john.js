		<div class="section">We met and talked- I shared lofty goals, and he some wisdom. \
		He told me he has been an idealist since sixteen, I, on the other hand,\
		 had recently kissed goodbye to my idealism. These are just mere words.\
		I know he is far more practical than he would want me to believe,\
		and I am still too unrealistic. This is what he taught me:\
		<ul>
		<li>Be a simple man. Don't own a lot of belongings. That your wardrobe should be miniamally essential\
		(and I think essentially minimal too).</li>
		<li>Start small. If you touch a single life a day, \
		that'd be roughly 1000 in little more than three years.</li>
		<li>Show your gimmick! (If you don't, get one. Referring to Gypsy: You Gotta Have a Gimmick)</li>
		<li>Every business plan you propose or anything you present, \
		the other parties have their own self-interests. Use your gimmick and\
		don't forget that it's your ideal you're fighting for, \
		but if you need to make the cut by keeping everyone happy.</li>
		</ul>
		Oh wait! "And never give up!" he'd keep remarking.
