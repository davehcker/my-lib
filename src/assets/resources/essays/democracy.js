<h2 class="subtitle"> Or, The Myth of Democracy</h2>
<br>Not so much unlike the animals in the classic political novel Animal Farm, the modern ‘civilized’ man too has to take a weird oath- “democracy good, non-democracy bad”. The oath is so deeply gnarled into our myopic outlook and understanding of governance that most of us will at first fail to recognize the weirdness in the statement- exactly like the animals that innocently chimed “four legs good, two legs bad”. As we shall see, such a simplistic approach to governance is not only naïve but also dangerous. How often do we ask ourselves how democratic a democracy is? An even more deeper and dangerous set of questions could be asked if we look at its different implementations, its vulnerabilities, and the ends to which we expect to be a solution for.

<p>Before we begin describing democracy in more specific terms, it is important (though not essential) for us to consider two relevant concepts- state, and power. In his paper titled Limited Statehood, Risse shows that Governance without a state is possible (Risse 9). For the purposes of this paper, however, I adopt the definition of democracy as a contingency to the concept of state; precisely, because this paper refers to modern state, which I have assumed to be pre-necessitated by a modern democratic state. There are two broad approaches that have been adopted to define the modern state. One way is in terms of what a state does and the interests it serves, and the other way is in terms of infrastructure i.e. how the state is structured rather that what interest it may serve (Gill 2). We will utilize both versions, more so, to exhaust the possibilities of the applicability of our claims. Power, then, can be described as the medium which serves to achieve the interests of the state, or to maintain its infrastructure (Gill 27).</p>

<p>Democracy originates in antiquity and stands for ‘rule by people’. The term ‘people’ by some stretch of the language and political fantasies has been replaced by ‘citizens’; this was as true in known antiquity as in contemporary modern states. On the other hand, aristocracy is a power by elites. At the onset itself, we can see a blurry picture of democracy mimicking a watered-down version of aristocracy where the ‘citizens’ and not just any people are the aristocrats. It is probably in a similar regard that it has been previously theorized that democracy could serve only the elite (Gill 4), however, my claim here is much stronger- a pure democracy is logically impossible! In fact, if we take other dependencies into consideration, few of which I describe later, then every democracy is helplessly doomed to converge to a kind of structure that stands in exact opposition to the very premise of an ideal democracy i.e. rule by people.</p>

<p>Assuming the pre-existence of domestic sovereignty (Gill 8), the state can also appropriately be perceived as an arena where a varying (or uniform) level of power is distributed among the participants. Democracy, then, is a descriptor of one such arena where the power is uniformly distributed among the participants i.e. people or citizens. In order for democracy to sustain, this uniform distribution of power has to be preserved through time, but this cannot be true. </p>

<p>Even if we assume power to be a zero-sum game within the arena of the state rule, there is no guarantee that power will not change hands. This exchange of power can, however, never reach a level such that it could become a threat to democracy, or so is the claim made by believers in democratic ideals. The argument becomes clearer when looking at a state in terms of infrastructure, an infrastructure to preserve the democracy. However, in a democracy, this infrastructure too has to be maintained in a way where power is not consolidated at any point to a degree that could be dangerous to the state’s democracy. Now, we can examine a democratic state holistically in terms of uniformly distributed power to direct and govern the state’s interests and an infrastructure that doesn’t hold too much of power at any point. But sustaining such a system in this equilibrium is impossible for human agents. On one hand, if the exchange of power is kept within required checks, it would need an overwhelmingly complex infrastructure, so much so that the system will come to a crippling halt and no work would be done, and consequently the infrastructure would have to consolidated into the hands of selected few (Tolbert), hence defeating the original purpose. On the other hand, if there is no or very little infrastructure, power, by its very own nature (“Domination and Legitimacy”), during the process of exchange will easily converge among a group or groups of agents. Again, we come to the same conclusion- the axioms of democracy cannot be true in a ‘democratic’ state.</p>

<p>Democracy, in the context of the modern state, is only an ideal; but like Platonic forms, it doesn’t exist on any land under the sun, but only in our thoughts. Because democracy is only an ideal destination in the governance of a state, its proponents should be very careful lest they should not get engulfed into their own fantasies. Democracy, in and by itself, is a means to the end of a proper dispatch of the interest of the state. We have seen in the previous paragraph how heavy the demands and contingencies of a state could get. Even though a study of the capacity requirements at the onset of democracy is beyond the scope of this paper, we can, nonetheless, take a look at some recent cases of democracies. If the collective well-being of the people is the end of democracy, then there should be a strong correlation between democracies and people’s well-being. However, contrary to our expectations, a recent study suggests that there is no strong relationship between a country’s current regime type (democratic or otherwise) and its subsequent human development (Gerring). </p>

<p>In some ways, one can aptly refer to the 21st century as the age of infatuation with democracy. The idea became an ideology, and as Orwell would put it, in the hands of two-legged pigs it became a tool. Starting with World War I, democracy as an ideology has been used to massacre people, plunder resources, curb fundamental rights, and sometimes even as a justification for devastating wars on peace (Chan). Before we too become or are recruited by the grand ungodly god-like Captain Ahab of democracy in today’s international context, let us first pause for a moment and first ask why we are seeking democracy and to what extent of the ideal we want to realize. This way, even though we might be slow in reaching the democratic utopia, but we will at least not be living in a sustained delusion instead of the realization of a true democracy.</p>
