	<p> If you have decided to go to college, or if you are stuck in one for whatever reasons, let me tell
	you what is the bare minimum that you should try to get out of your traditional 4-year college life.
	You won't be too wrong to assume that your college years are going to dramatically impact your 
	future trajectory and almost disproportionally define you as a person.</p>
	<p> I roughly followed the following schedule. Of course, it is only looking back in time that I can 
	put them in a list. I think I was lucky to have them ordered in this way, and it worked in my case; 
	but I don't think that the order is necessary. </p>

	<p><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Freshman:</span> Begin a new life. If your highschool to college
	 progression seems too smooth, something is wrong. Your essays should get crisper or weirder.</p>
	<p><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Sophomore:</span> Start studying everything you can. 
	 Find ideals, fight for them and/or kill them. Seek all the advice you can. You don't have to be
	 an extrovert, you can be (or even better, should be) a decent jerk to yourself.</p>

	<p><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Junior:</span> Seek perfect solitude. This is going to be 
	the most challenging part. You will have to (re)discover yourself. If you start around this year 
	of your college, you'd have accrued better results towards your goal. Your speech would change, the way you see the world
	would change, and I'm assuming the way the world perceives you is going to change too.</p>

	<p><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Senior:</span> Go public! I think senior year of college 
	is pretty much extraneous<sup>[1]</sup>. Your best bet in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is to use this year for planning
	 out your independence- starting a company, getting a job, devoting yourself to a field you find yourself 
	 at home in. A heuristic as to whether you wrapped up your college years well is if you really want 
	 to attend your commencement. The answer should be a clear no, or at least a definite ambivalence.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p class="has-text-weight-semibold"> NOTES </p>
	 <p>[1] I think it's roughly the same as human gestation period of 9 months. Why precisely 9 months?
	 We don't know yet and I guess we just have to believe that it's there for some good reason. Same goes with senior year. 
	 Let's hope it's there for some good reason. <p>
