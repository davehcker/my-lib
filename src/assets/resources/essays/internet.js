tldr; I see the Internet as a force, and not as a mere medium. And I think that has major consequences for the beginner's mind.

<span class="has-text-weight-semibold">“Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”</span>

<p> The Internet (i.e. the global internet) is such a water thing nowadays. Most of us breathe and live in it; it is a fiber that we (and it itself (recursively)) is a part of. Probably it is this mutual indistinguishability of it and us and you and me that makes it such a subtle bizarreness. But like any human creation, it is never beyond the quashing ruthlessness of human intelligence. You might think you understand the Internet, but I bet you understand it only as much as you claim to truly understand our mortal life.</p>

<p> A cardiologist understands the heart. Or does he/ she?<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> Oh, wait! Maybe you have a solid understanding of computer networks and some web technologies, and boy you understand it all! I too used to explain the internet on a piece of tissue paper, but now I don’t. </p>

<p>I met the Internet when I was around 8 or 9 years old behind an awesome (at that time) ADSL connection; the year, I guess, was 2004. Even though the connection was permanent, my life was not. For some reasons, I had to move back and forth between places and the charm of the internet was fully bestowed only for a few months a year. But nonetheless, I had tasted it. I would always conjure up ideas and thoughts of how it must all work and how just a simple call to the local telephone exchange would fix the problem in case the internet link was down. Those IP addresses and DNS fields were just all spells. I thought I understood it all- wires, routers, and servers. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Fast forward, the year is 2019, and I still don’t get the Internet. It is bizarre (more than the quarks, but not beyond a higher degree than the human bodies they (the quarks) build). Of course, I get the protocols, the networking stuff and all full-stack development that rules and runs the modern Internet. But right at the cusp of where you get it, you lose it too. As soon as you grasp it, it becomes intangible. Jeff Bezos very early on in his career referred to the internet as an equivalent of the electric current<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. And he was right in one regard i.e. that it enables other things. He hinted at the Internet as a medium was concerned with the business aspect (the Internet being a medium that delivers goodness), and I believe I can’t do any better in coming up with another analogy. However, here I am venturing into something subtle, yet purely real (at least as real as a $1 bill is).</p>

<p>The traditional version of the Internet’s definition seems to be that it’s a medium. That’s true and probably historically more accurate<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>, but at a much richer picture (and of course more complicated too) comes up when you think of the Internet as a force. And this is where most people (especially the ones who work in technology- the nerds, programmers, sysAdmins, etc.) don’t get the Internet correctly. When I used to think of the Internet, I used to think of it as a bigger ARPANET. But the truth is that the metamorphosis of the internet from a medium to a force already took place a long time ago. See, a screwdriver has remained a tool. We never philosophize the atoms that compose it or ever wonder why the atoms that are not glued together never slip, whereas the top wears out easily. The thing is there was no need to and to do would be completely ridiculous and useless. The Internet, however, has gone beyond medium nature. It is as if a force has started emanating out of it, just a very few years after its big-bang.</p>

<p>The Internet now is a force, a widely accessible force that permeates (almost) everything in and of our modern lives. Like any force that can be conjured, the Jedi, the Sith, and everyone in between is after. And that is where Facebook, citizenship applications, e-banks, TikTok, IP throttling, cheap lower-orbital satellites, and everything else in between comes into play the game. It is clear that we understand this force much better than gravitation. Lucky nerds! The poor physicists, on the other hand, are still losing their minds over gravitational waves and all of its mysteries.</p>

<p>So what difference does it make if the internet is a medium or a force? A lot! Force, unlike a medium/tool, is abstract; it is magical and can be conjured by those who understand it (and humble ones will easily do so). There are only so many unique ways to use a screwdriver. Likewise, an investment bank, for example, can pull off only so many options and derivatives. But the Internet is limitless (at least for quite some now). It is still unfinished!<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup></p>

Even though it is very essential for a great university to have a great building, but its essence and true majesty lies in what is holds inside the building- both physical and abstract. This essay was written to highlight that a lot of us are erring in deeming that the Internet is just the building- no, that's the past. A very good hint is to just look at how a ton of Physical Layer options have shown up in the computer networks, and one can technically replace the other with no noticeable difference. The building era is not as important anymore.`
